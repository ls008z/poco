# Poco Documentation

Welcome to the Poco documentation. This guide will help you understand how to use and contribute to the Poco package.

## About Poco

Poco is being developed as a simulation engine for power and cover curve analysis with user-specified estimators. The package aims to provide tools for:

- Generating synthetic data for statistical simulations
- Implementing and comparing different statistical estimators
- Visualizing power curves across different parameters
- Analyzing coverage probabilities of confidence intervals
- Comparing the performance of different estimation methods

## Current Status

Poco is currently in early development (v0.1.0). The initial release provides a basic package structure with minimal functionality. Future versions will implement the full simulation engine capabilities.

## Quick Start

Currently, Poco provides a simple greeting function:

```python
from poco import main

main()  # Prints "Hello from poco!"
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
poco  # Prints "Hello from poco!"
```

Stay tuned for updates as we develop the full simulation engine functionality!
